# Dynamic Form with React Hook Form

This project showcases a dynamic form built with React, TypeScript, and the `react-hook-form` library. The main feature of the project is to dynamically add and manage form fields, with the additional functionality of disabling options selected in one field from being available in subsequent dynamically added fields.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Fields:** Utilize `useFieldArray` from `react-hook-form` to dynamically add and manage form fields.
- **Conditional Field Disabling:** Prevent the selection of options in a dynamically added field that have been selected in a previous field.
- **React DevTools Integration:** Leverage `react-hook-form/devtools` for improved form debugging.
